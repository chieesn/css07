	<p>Anohana has been considered one of the best anime of the 2010s by Polygon; writer Julia Lee highlighted how "Anohana has turned the toughest people into crying puddles on the floor, not only because the entire premise is built around a tragedy, but because it’s a reminder that friends grow apart and people change".[25] Crunchyroll also included it in such a list; reviewer Daryl Harding commented that the anime "blew the tear buds of people all around the world" and that "Somehow the team can just pull at your heartstrings so much that even nearly a decade on, I still feel those tugs".[26] Writing for Forbes, Lauren Orsini considered it to be one of the five best anime of 2011; she wrote, "Anohana is a moving journey about the ties that bind even beyond the grave that will leave you misty-eyed".

In Chichibu, Saitama, a group of six sixth-grade-age childhood friends drift apart after one of them, Meiko "<span class="a">Menma</span>" Honma, dies in an accident. Five years after the incident, the leader of the group, Jinta Yadomi, has withdrawn from society, does not attend high school, and lives as a recluse. One summer day, the ghost of an older-looking <span class="a">Menma</span> appears beside him and asks to have a wish granted, reasoning that she cannot pass on into the afterlife until it is fulfilled. At first, he only tries to help her minimally because he thinks he is hallucinating. But since <span class="a">Menma</span> does not remember what her wish is, Jinta gathers his estranged friends together once again, believing that they are the key to solving this problem. All of the group joins him, though most of them do so reluctantly. However, things grow increasingly complicated when his friends accuse him of not being able to get over <span class="a">Menma</span>'s death, as they cannot see her and believe Jinta is hallucinating. <span class="a">Menma</span> shows her presence to the group in order to prove that she is indeed real. All the group members eventually wish to shoulder the blame for <span class="a">Menma</span>'s death and long-hidden feelings among the group are rekindled. The group struggles as they grow from trying to help <span class="a">Menma</span> move on and help each other move on as well.
